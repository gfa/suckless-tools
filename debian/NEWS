suckless-tools (41-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The slock screen locker has been patched in Debian and is now using
  PAM for authentication, instead of reading the shadow file. This means
  that slock can authenticate the user using some other mechanism for
  login (i.e., NIS passwords, fingerprint readers, etc). In addition,
  we avoid installing slock with setuid-root or setgid-shadow permissions.
