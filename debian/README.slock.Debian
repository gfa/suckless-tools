slock is a very simple screen locker. After locking the screen you have to
type your password (without any feedback), hit enter and the screen will be
unlocked.

Please Note:
Slock checks the password against shadow, so it needs at least read 
permissions for the /etc/shadow file.
On Debian this is done by setgid slock to shadow. After getting the password
entry, slock drops rights. However, assuming that there is any security issue
with slock, an attacker maybe could read the shadow-file.
